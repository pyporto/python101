New stuff: lists, sets, input, for-loops


Hints
=====

- For the first time in our life we initialized a variable. Note that we don't
  set the variable type, it's defined on the fly at the moment of the assignment
- This variable happens to be an empty list.
- Lists are like arrays, but you don't have to worry about memory
  allocation. They're extended dynamically.
- for-loops in Python look much more natural, than in C.
- range(N) is a special function which generates sequential numbers, by default
  from 0 with step 1
- There is a built-in function input() to take user input
- You can pass any object to print(). It's convenient for debugging


Playing with the code
=====================

- Show how to initialize non-empty list: things = ['foo', 'bar']
- Try to replace list with set and see what's common and what's different:
  - unique values
  - order is not preserved
  - add instead append
  - you still can iterate
