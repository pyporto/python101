Hints
=====

- No parentheses around if-expressions needed
- If-expressions are formatted with colon and indentation too
- There is a special elif keyword
- There is no switch/case syntax
- sys.argv is a Python list. It's like C array, but easier to use

On imports
==========

- For the first time we imported an external module "sys". Python is known
  as coming with "batteries included". Sys in particular gives access to
  command line arguments
- Calling module functions and arguments semantic is close to calling
  object methods or attributes. Module provides a namespace

On string formatting
====================

- There are multiple ways to format python strings. Here we use a format
  method of the string object
- Yeah, string is an object. This object has methods which you can call
