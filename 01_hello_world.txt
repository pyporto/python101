Hints
====

- Functions are defined with def
- Curly braces are not used. Instead, used colons and indentations
- print instead of printf, and it automatically adds a newline
- Main function can have any name, but it has to be called explicitly
- Use can use single or double quotes to wrap strings. It's equal
- How run the code: python 01_hello_world.py

Playing with the code
=====================

Let's modify and run the script

- Let's remove indentation and see what happens
- Let's remove colon to see what happens
- Convert this to one-liner print('Hello world')

Show REPL
=========

- REPL stands for "read-eval-print-loop"
- python without arguments opens a REPL console which is convenient
  to experiment
- Run the same "Hello world" right from the REPL

What to ignore
==============

- The if __name__ == '__main__' syntax
