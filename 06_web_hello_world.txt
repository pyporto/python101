Code explanation
================

- We have to install Flask first with "pip install flask"
- Notice how dependencies are also installed
- app is created outside of any function. Object will be created
  once on the first input, or when we call this file for execition
- That @app.route thing is called a decorator
- In this particular case decorator shows which function will be called
  in response to opening this or that URL
- Flask uses angle-brackets to parametrize URLs. The parameter goes to
  the function as its input parameter
- Application has a method .run() to start the development webserver
